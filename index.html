		<p>The whale shark, or <i>Rhincodon typus</i>, is the largest known extant (currently living) species of fish in the world. Despite their intimidating size, whale sharks are filter feeders, and as such are completely harmless to humans. This website contains basic information about whale sharks.</p>

			<h2>Biology, habitat, and behavior</h2>
			
			<p>Being the largest species of fish in the world, whale sharks can grow up to 40 feet (around 12 meters in length and weigh up to 47,000 pounds (21.5 tons). Their mouths alone can be 5 feet (1.5 meters) wide! They are greyish in color with white bellies, as well as pale yellow spots and stripes that are unique to each whale shark. As filter feeders, their diet consists of krill and other small invertebrates.</p>

			<p>Whale sharks are found in tropical and warm-temperate seas all over the world. They are typically pelagic, which means they live in the open ocean but do not usually dive into deeper waters.</p>

			<p>Whale sharks are migratory animals. Mating and birthing of whale sharks have never been directly observed, but it is known that whale sharks give birth to live young. Juvenile whale sharks (as well juveniles of any other species of shark) are called "pups". Whale sharks are very docile, and will allow divers to swim near them without interruption. Some younger whale sharks will even play with divers!</p>

			<h2>Where can I see a whale shark?</h2>

			<p>Due to their huge size and status as an endangered species, captive whale sharks are only found in a select few aquariums around the world. The only aquarium in North America that currently houses whale sharks is the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, Georgia. A few aquariums in Japan and China also have whale sharks on display.</p>

			<p>Below is a table detailing aquariums where whale sharks can be seen.</p>
